Abstract—A dual-mode (CDMA/AMPS) power amplifier has
been successfully implemented by using a monolithic SiGe/Si heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) foundry process for cellular
handset (824–849 MHz) applications. The designed two-stage
power amplifier satisfies both CDMA and AMPS requirements in
output power, linearity, and efficiency. At = 3 V, the power
amplifier shows an excellent linearity (first ACPR 44.1 dBc
and second ACPR 57.1 dBc) up to 28 dBm of output power
for CDMA applications. Under the same bias condition, the
power amplifier also meets AMPS handset requirements in
output power (up to 31 dBm) and linearity (with second and
third harmonic to fundamental ratios lower than 37 dBc and
55 dBc, respectively). At the maximum output power level, the
worst power-added efficiencies (PAEs) are measured to be 36%
for CDMA and 49% for AMPS operations. The power amplifier
also tolerates severe output mismatch (VSWR 12 : 1) up to
= 4 V, with spurs measured to be 22 dBc in CDMA
outputs at two specific tuning angles, but with no spur in AMPS
outputs at any tuning angle.

I. INTRODUCTION
F OR THE past several years, AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction
bipolar transistor (HBT) power amplifiers have dominated
the CDMA handset transmitter market due to their excellent linearity and power-added efficiency (PAE). However,
GaAs-based integrated circuits are relatively expensive and
must be thinned for optimum performance in power amplification. Compared with AlGaAs/GaAs HBTs, SiGe/Si HBTs are
more attractive primarily due to their high substrate thermal
conductivity (150 W/m- C), comparable device performance
( 30 GHz and 50 GHz), lower emitter/base turn-on
voltage ( 0.75 V), and substantially lower production cost.
Unfortunately, SiGe/Si HBTs have their own disadvantages:
the substrate is very conductive, adding significant parasitics
to both active and passive components of the power amplifier.
SiGe HBTs also have relatively low breakdown voltages
( 5 V; 14.5 V) and low Early voltage ( 140 V)
versus 1000 V in GaAs HBTs. These characteristics are

detrimental to the gain, linearity, and dynamic range of the
power amplifier.
Recently, efforts have been made in making SiGe/Si HBT
power amplifiers for DECT and GSM handset transmission applications [1]–[4]. However, the output power of the DECT is
relatively low (24 dBm) and the linearity requirement of the
GSM is far less restrictive than that of the CDMA. To further
demonstrate the linearity and PAE of the SiGe HBT power amplifier at a significant power level, we have designed and characterized a monolithic SiGe/Si HBT power amplifier for dual
mode (CDMA/AMPS) cellular handset applications.
The power amplifier design specifications are:
1) Maximum output power: 28 dBm for CDMA and
31 dBm for AMPS;
2) Linearity for CDMA: first ACPR 44.1 dBc and
second ACPR 57.1 dBc with offset frequencies set at
885 kHz and 1980 kHz, respectively. The detailed measurement specifications are described in [5];
3) Linearity for AMPS: with second and third harmonic to
fundamental ratios 30 dBc at any output power level;
4) Power-Added Efficiency (PAE): 35% for CDMA and
45% for AMPS measured at the peak output power
level.

Abstract - A standard-compliant integrated quadband GSM/EDGE radio frequency power amplifier for
824-915 MHz and 1710-1910 MHz has been realized in
a 0.35-,um SiGe-Bipolar technology. The chip integrates
two single-ended 3-stage power amplifiers and a biascontrol circuit for power control, band select and mode
dependent quiescent currents. At 3.3 V a saturated
output power of 35.9dBm is achieved at 830MHz and
32.3 dBm at 1710 MHz. The respective peak PAE is 56 %
for low-band and 44 % for high-band.

circuits, analog circuits, GSM, EDGE, mobile phone Fig. 1 shows the circuit diagram of the power amplifier. Starting with the low-band RF core (top), the PA
represents a 2-stage amplifier in EDGE mode and a 3-
stage amplifier in GMSK mode. The switching is done
via bias currents. In addition transistors which shunt
the RF signal at the base of the inactive transistor
prevent undesired self-biasing in the disabled path.
In GMSK mode the PA uses a high-pass type input
matching for the input transistor T4. To achieve an
acceptable noise performance, all low-band stages
are biased using chokes which are on-chip except

for the output stage. In EDGE mode the RF signal
bypasses directly to the second stage (T5) with the
first stage (T4) switched off. This results in a gain
step of about -10 dB and offers a better noise performance. The creation of an RF matching that achieves
a homogenous RF input current to each transistor
cell is a design challenge. Hence, in the low-band a
series capacitor is used in combination with four shunt
inductors supplying the output stage which is split into
8blocks, each biased with its own current mirror. In
the high-band a physically asymmetric but electrically
symmetric (L,C,R) fishbone structure facilitates the
RF current distribution to the transistor blocks. The
planar structure is optimized by EM simulations. The
transistor blocks are layouted with base, emitter and
collector stripes connected on both sides to improve
the breakdown behavior. Thus, the effective transistor
length with respect to current crowding is halved. In
addition the ruggedness of a double-side connected
40 ,um long emitter is even better compared to a singleside connected 20 ,m one. Due to the extremely low
base impedance of about 200 mQ a wideband multistage matching with low losses is necessary to achieve
the required driving power into the output stage. To
overcome the considerably lower Q-factor available
on a low-ohmic substrate, the interstage matching is
realized using an inductive fishbone structure followed
by an LC-type matching with planar inductors. To
